# hangman

Coded in Ruby

A command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer. This program utilizes the reading and writing of files in order to choose words and create save files. Words are chosen from a prepopulated text file and saves are saved in a csv format (however the save file type is a .txt file). This program also makes extensive use of classes and objects

A live version of this program can be found on [repl.it](https://replit.com/@VincenzoY/hangman#main.rb). Simply click the "run" button in the center top of the screen.

This project was made based on an assignment from *The Odin Project*. [Link to assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization)
